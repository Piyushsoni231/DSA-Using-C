# DSA-Using-C
Welcome to the DSA-Using-C repository! This project features core Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a valuable learning resource for beginners and developers aiming to deepen their understanding of these fundamental concepts.

🚀 Features
This repository covers the following topics:

1. 📜 Stacks

LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
Use cases: Expression evaluation, function call management.

3. 📜 Queues

FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek.
Use cases: Task scheduling, print queue management.

4. 📁 Arrays

Contiguous memory allocation.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.
Use cases: Static data storage, indexing.

6. 🔗 Linked Lists

Dynamic memory allocation.
Types: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal.
Use cases: Dynamic data structures, implementing stacks and queues.

7. 📊 Sorting Algorithms

Types: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
Use cases: Organizing data, optimization problems, searching algorithms.
