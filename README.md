# DSA-Using-C
Welcome to the DSA-Using-C repository! This project features core Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a valuable learning resource for beginners and developers aiming to deepen their understanding of these fundamental concepts.

🚀 Features
This repository covers the following topics:

1. 📜 Stacks
LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
Use cases: Expression evaluation, function call management.
2. 📜 Queues
FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek.
Use cases: Task scheduling, print queue management.
3. 📁 Arrays
Contiguous memory allocation.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.
Use cases: Static data storage, indexing.
4. 🔗 Linked Lists
Dynamic memory allocation.
Types: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal.
Use cases: Dynamic data structures, implementing stacks and queues.
5. 🌐 Graphs
Types: Directed and undirected graphs.
Representation: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
Operations: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search).
Use cases: Networking, social media connections, pathfinding algorithms.
6. 📊 Sorting Algorithms
Types: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
Use cases: Organizing data, optimization problems, searching algorithms.
